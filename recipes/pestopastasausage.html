        <ul>
            <li>Bowtie pasta</li>
            <li>Italian sausage</li>
            <li>Onion</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start your Sausage Pesto Pasta by cooking your
                bow-tie pasta in some salted water until theyâ€™re
                al dente. Reserve about 1/2 a cup of water to use
                later, drain, and set aside.</li>

            <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the Italian sausage
                to a hot skillet and break apart. Cook until it is
                all browned, then remove from pan.</li>

            <li>Next, add some olive oil and the sliced onion to
                the same pan and cook until caramelized, soft,
                and browned.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked sausage back to the pan with the
                onion, making sure you get any residual juices.</li>
            <li>Next add the frozen peas to the pan.</li>
            <li>Then add the pesto, reserved pasta water, and
                lemon juice to create your sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the pan, season with some
                salt and pepper, and stir it all together.</li>
            <li>Finish by adding the parmigiano-reggiano and
                freshly cut parsley atop your pasta dish.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy your Sausage Pesto Pasta with
                Onions and Peas.</li>
